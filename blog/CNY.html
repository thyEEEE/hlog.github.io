        <h1>CNY</h1>
        <p1>
            By the way CNY means Chinese new year. 
            This years' CNY is sooo boring dude.
            Like I don't even do anything. That's all I can share.
            No one care about my blog anyway ðŸ¤“. I think that the tweet function I made is so cool but it took me some effort, maybe I will change my schedule. 
            I am too lazy to update my blog every Friday.
