        <h1>My Genius Idea To Earn Money</h1>
        <p1>
            Hear me out.
            I just thought about an idea.
            How about I sell a course that teaches people how to code in html css and js,
            and for the js part I will make them pay like 5$.
            Is that too much or too less?
            Whatever discord dm me about the price.
            Anyways like I was saying, I want to make it like "learn html css in 100 days".
            I think I will do it on a website and then make it like have exercise and teaching etc.
            And when people have problem learning they can just dm me.
            Epik idea.
            I will update later if I make one.
        </br>

            By the way I won't make the tweet function web responsive because I am too lazy. Maybe one day I will make a function so people can add comments.
            I don't really care for real.
            (I don't think anyone is visiting my blog anyways.)
