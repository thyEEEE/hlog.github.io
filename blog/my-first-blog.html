        <h1>My First Blog</h1>
        <p1>I just going to talk about some random things. 
            The reason why I created this blog website is because I saw someone on discord have her own blog post.
            And I think that's pretty cool so why don't I create one blog also right.
            Anyways, recently I've been learning c# to make a desktop app.
            I believe the framework I used is called "mafu mafu" or something.
            It is similar to html(maybe).
            I only see the example because I don't know what to code.
            That's it for today.
            I think I will add a function that can let me post blog on another website.
